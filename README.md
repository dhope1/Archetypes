Personality Archetype Quiz
A dynamic, interactive web application built with React and CSS to help users discover their personality archetype (e.g., Alpha, Sigma, Beta) through a 13-question quiz. Features include user registration with local storage, a progress bar, animated transitions, and a results page displaying the top three archetypes with percentages. Users can share results via clipboard, retake the quiz, or download their data as a JSON file for analysis. Designed for young adults with a modern, gaming-inspired UI, this project showcases state management, client-side data persistence, and responsive design.
